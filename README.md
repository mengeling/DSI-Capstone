# Silvercar Cancellation Predictor

## Background and Motivation

Silvercar is a startup rental car company that aims to take the pain out of the car rental process.
One way they accomplish this goal is by offering users flexibility with their reservations. Users aren't
charged for cancellations and no-shows, and they don't have to enter credit card information or create
a Silvercar account to make reservations. This policy is great for customers, but it creates a business problem
for the company because roughly 41% of their reservations aren't completed.

## Objective

I set out to create a model that could predict which reservations will be cancelled to help Silvercar:
- Better manage their fleet of cars (less cars sitting around unused)
- Improve short-term revenue forecasting
- Potentially identify opportunities to prevent cancellations
